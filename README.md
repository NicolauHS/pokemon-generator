# Pokemon Generator

This is a simple script to generate pokemon attributes based on the official information for Pokemon available on bulbapedia. It goes through the whole process of:

 - Getting the pokemon's base stats
 - Generating IVs
 - Generating a random nature
 - Galculating the final stats with all the previous information
 - Printing a summary of the pokemon on screen

And produces a team of random pokemon with equivalent stats to ones you'd find in the official games.

**It currently *does NOT***:

 - Set EVs and calculate them, although it fairly easily could
 - Generate pokemon that came after the first generations of games

All the data for this project was gathered from [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page) and [Pok√©mon DB](https://pokemondb.net/)
